# Enou-Cipher
The Enou Cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter of the alphabet is replaced by one of the six letters G, H, I, T, S or U. Due to the fact that each of these six letters can represent a total of up to 5 different letters of plaintext, the lossy aspect of the cipher is created.


| G | H | I | T | S | U |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A, D, U, X | B, E, S, V, Y | C, F, T, W, Z | H, K, N, Q | G, J, M, P | I, L, O, R |
