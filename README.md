# Enou-Cipher
The Enou Cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter of the alphabet is replaced by one of the six letters G, H, I, T, S or U. Due to the fact that each of these six letters can represent a total of up to 5 different letters of plaintext, the lossy aspect of the cipher is created.


| G | H | I | T | S |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| E, T, G, K| Space, Y, J, Q, Z | I, S, H, M, B, X | A, R, L, U, F, V | O, N, D, C, W, P |
